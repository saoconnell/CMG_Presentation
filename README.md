Y_1 							| Generated prototype data used in the demostration, created by the prototypes.R program
Y_2 							| Generated prototype data used in the demostration, created by the prototypes.R program
Y_3 							| Generated prototype data used in the demostration, created by the prototypes.R program

demo_1.R 						| Contains the first demo showing SVM training and predication with one set of training data
demo_2.R 						| Contains the second demo showing how the SVM model accuracy can be improved by providing more training data
helperFunctions.R 				| Code to create the feature matrix, confusion matrix output, and diagnositic function used for analysis of mis-classified prototypes.
prototypes.R 					| Program to generate the prototype data in the different utilization patterns of interest
tune_svm.obj.Rdput 				| Output from the tuning process.  This process was quite long, so rather that run throught it in the demo I provide the output here in a format the can be loaded into an R session for further analysis.
tune_svm.obj1.Rdput 			| Output from the tuning process.  This process was quite long, so rather that run throught it in the demo I provide the output here in a format the can be loaded into an R session for further analysis.
tune_svm.obj2.Rdput 			| Output from the tuning process.  This process was quite long, so rather that run throught it in the demo I provide the output here in a format the can be loaded into an R session for further analysis.
